We expected climate factors to be more important at coarse resolutions and biotic factors at finer resolutions. We used data on occurrence of a parasitic plant (<i>Phoradendron californicum</i>), restricted to parts of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, to analyze how climate and mobility factors explain its distributional area. We developed analyses at five spatial resolutions (1, 5, 10, 20, 50 km) within the distributional area of the disperser species, and compared ecological niche models from three commonly used correlative methods with a process-based model that estimates colonization and extinction rates in a metapopulation framework. Correlative models improved when layers associated with hosts and disperser were used as predictors, in comparison with models based on climate only; however, they tended to overfit to data as more layers were added. Dispersal-related parameters were more relevant at finer resolutions (1–5 km), but importance of extinction-related parameters did not change with scale. We observed greater coincidence between correlative and process-based models when based only on dimensions of the abiotic niche (i.e., climate), but a clearer and more comprehensive mechanistic understanding was derived from the process-based algorithm.</p> </div><div class="artAuthors"><div class="hlFld-ContribAuthor"></div></div><div class="hlFld-Keyword"><p class="fulltext"><font size="-1"><span class="keywordsLabel">Key words:  </span><a name="" href="/keyword/colonization">colonization</a>, <a name="" href="/keyword/dispersal">dispersal</a>, <a name="" href="/keyword/extinction">extinction</a>, <a name="" href="/keyword/geographic range">geographic range</a>, <a name="" href="/keyword/metapopulation">metapopulation</a>, <a name="" href="/keyword/Phoradendron californicum"><i>Phoradendron californicum</i></a></font></p></div></div><!-- /abstract content --><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""></a> <div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"></a> <b>†</b> <b>E-mail:</b> <a class="email" href="mailto:aliranoriega@gmail.com"><span class="nobrWithWbr">aliranoriega@gmail.<wbr xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"></wbr>com</span></a> </div> <a name=""></a> <p class="first last"><b>Received</b> 30 April 2013; revised 5 June 2013; accepted 7 June 2013; <b>published</b> 20 August 2013.</p>  <a name="copyright"></a> <p class="first last"><b>Copyright:</b> © 2013 Lira-Noriega et al.

Understanding how patterns at one scale are manifestations of or influence processes operating at other scales is a particular challenge (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Levin2')">Levin and Pacala 1997</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Pearson1')">Pearson and Dawson 2003</a>, Hastings et al. 2010). The core of this challenge lies in disentangling how changes in scale affect the importance of different factors in shaping species' distributional patterns and processes.</p> <p>When studying species' distributions, it is useful to distinguish interacting variables from those that are dynamically uncoupled from the presence or abundance of the species in question (scenopoetic variables; <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Hutchinson1')">Hutchinson 1978</a>). These variables may have contrasting effects at fine versus coarse spatial resolutions (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Wiens1')">Wiens 1989</a>). The many ways in which scenopoetic variables operate at different extents and resolutions can be used to explain distributions of the species and propose scale-dependent hypotheses regarding factors most relevant at different scales (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Pulliam1')">Pulliam 2000</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Gaston1')">Gaston 2003</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon4')">Soberón and Peterson 2005</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon1')">Soberón 2007</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon2')">2010</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Peterson3')">Peterson et al. 2011</a>).</p> <p>Using data available documenting species' occurrence and climatic variation, researchers have been able to estimate environmental requirements of many species across broad regions (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Guisan1')">Guisan and Zimmermann 2000</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Elith1')">Elith et al. 2006</a>). Factors manifested at finer resolutions are less well studied at the scope of broad geographic ranges, leaving a gap in understanding as to how effects of these factors vary spatially and temporally. Also, knowledge of species' distributions at local scales may be sparse or biased spatially across geographic ranges, which makes analyzing the relative importance of variables even more difficult (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-MacArthur1')">MacArthur 1972</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Levin1')">Levin 1992</a>). These considerations explain why studies of spatial distributions of species that combine broad-scale and fine-scale views remain uncommon (e.g., <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Mackey1')">Mackey and Lindenmayer 2001</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Gaston2')">Gaston et al. 2004</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Heikkinen1')">Heikkinen et al. 2007</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Cunningham1')">Cunningham et al. 2009</a>).</p> <p>Correlative and process-based modeling are two approaches for exploring factors important in determining distributions of species at different spatial scales (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Robertson1')">Robertson et al. 2003</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Kearney2')">Kearney et al. 2010</a>). The main difference between these approaches is that correlative methods simply seek associations between environments and occurrences from across broad geographic ranges, whereas process-based methods incorporate explicit hypotheses about biological processes (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Robertson1')">Robertson et al. 2003</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Kearney1')">Kearney and Porter 2009</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Monahan1')">Monahan 2009</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Morin1')">Morin and Thuiller 2009</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Cabral1')">Cabral and Schurr 2010</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Kearney2')">Kearney et al. 2010</a>). In particular, a set of factors that is emerging as crucial in process-based modeling studies is dispersal: incorporating dispersal factors improves model performance markedly (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Allouche1')">Allouche et al. 2008</a>, Cabral and Schur 2010, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Brotons1')">Brotons et al. 2012</a>).</p> <p>In this paper, we explore how dispersal and scenopoetic factors act synergistically to explain the distribution of the Desert Mistletoe, <i>Phoradendron californicum</i>, at varying spatial resolutions. <i>P. californicum</i> is a hemi-parasitic plant associated with legume hosts in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, and it is dispersed in largest part by the bird species <i>Phainopepla nitens</i> (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Walsberg1')">Walsberg 1975</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Kuijt1')">Kuijt 2003</a>). This parasite-host-disperser system offers two advantages for understanding how scaling of biological processes govern distributions (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton2')">Overton 1996</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Aukema3')">Aukema and Martínez del Rio 2002</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Aukema1')">Aukema 2003</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Aukema2')">2004</a>): (1) hosts are known, and their distributions can be studied at high spatial resolution using aerial photographs; and (2) dispersal is determined chiefly by a single disperser. We modeled the portion of the distribution of <i>P. californicum</i> in the U.S., where detailed data on <i>Phainopepla nitens</i> are available (almost 900,000 km<sup>2</sup>; <a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03')">Fig. 1</a>), encompassing approximately half of the parasite species' range. We compare commonly-used correlative niche modeling methods (GARP, Maxent, GAM) with a process-based model derived from a metapopulation-dynamic framework coupling rates of colonization and extinction. Following <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Pearson1')">Pearson and Dawson (2003</a>) and others, we hypothesize that, as resolution coarsens, variables associated with abiotic factors (e.g., climate) will become more important, but that the opposite will apply for biotic variables (e.g., dispersal).</p> <div id="s1a" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2"> <span class="title2" id="d2656322e473">Conceptual framework</span>  <p>To help understand causal factors underlying geographic distributions of species, a heuristic device called the BAM diagram is useful (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon4')">Soberón and Peterson 2005</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Peterson3')">Peterson et al. 2011</a>). The BAM diagram displays relationships between abiotic or uncoupled (<b>A</b>) and coupled biotic factors (<b>B</b>), and the movement or dispersal capacities of the species (<b>M</b>). This framework can be used to make explicit the possible arrangements of factors that determine distributions of species, and gives the opportunity to generate hypothetical scenarios, depending on the degree and geometry of their overlap (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f04" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f04')">Fig. 2</a>). Specifically, with this framework, we can analyze interactions of factors at fine and coarse spatial resolutions.</p> <p>In the mistletoe-host-disperser system, the BAM diagram can be simplified significantly by making some reasonable assumptions. The conditions manifested across <b>A</b> (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon4')">Soberón and Peterson 2005</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Soberon1')">Soberón 2007</a>) represent those under which the species can have a positive growth rate (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Hutchinson1')">Hutchinson 1978</a>); therefore, conditions in <b>A</b> are linked intimately to the environmental dimensions on which mechanisms of establishment and survivorship depend (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Wiens2')">Wiens 2000</a>). Factors in <b>M</b> are related to movement: what happens across <b>M</b> determines how populations will be structured, demographically and genetically, although testing this particular idea will be accomplished in a later phase of this project (Lira-Noriega et al., <i>unpublished manuscript</i>).</p> <p>We hypothesize that, to a first degree of approximation, the interaction with the host can be regarded as uncoupled, since hosts have expected lifetimes at least 10-fold longer than those of parasites (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton2')">Overton 1996</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton3')">1997</a>) and therefore their population dynamics can be regarded as approximately static relative to the faster demography of the parasites. The simplifying assumption of uncoupled dynamics of the total host population is often made in epidemiological studies (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Anderson1')">Anderson 1981</a>). This means that we regard climate and presence of hosts as part of the <b>A</b> circle. Second, we did not include the effect of competitors, which are not known to be present, nor of herbivores or pollinators, because information about them at the spatial extent of our study is simply unavailable.</p> <p class="last">Finally, in the mistletoe system, one major biotic factor, birds, act directly as dispersers. From a certain point of view the dispersers may be considered as part of <b>B</b>, but their effect is clearly felt in the dispersal circle, making <b>B</b> and <b>M</b> coincident. In consequence, we can simplify our system to a two-factor diagram: the abiotic climatic factors (<b>A</b>) and the hosts substrate, that determine overall potential distributions, and the movement or dispersal capacity of the species (<b>M</b>), driven mainly by the bird that disperses seeds among trees. <b>M</b> represents a hypothesis of the regions that have been accessible for the species over relevant time periods; as such, <b>M</b> is the area across which models should be calibrated (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Barve1')">Barve et al. 2011</a>; see also <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Acevedo1')">Acevedo et al. 2012</a>). Following this reasoning, we designated an <b>M</b> as the area of distribution of the mistletoe's main disperser, <i>P. nitens</i>, for which we have detailed abundance information (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03')">Fig. 1</a>). Although other potential dispersers of the mistletoe species in question are known, none is as closely associated as this species (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Walsberg1')">Walsberg 1975</a>); adding the densities of other bird species to the model would not have changed our results, given that they overlap broadly in their distribution and behavior with that of <i>P. nitens</i>. This assumption can be relaxed in future studies, but for the present simplifies the process-based modeling exercise considerably.</p> </div> </div><div id="s2" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1"> <a name="_i4"><!-- title --></a><table class="sectionHeading" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" width="95%">Methods</th></tr></table> <p>We designed a comparison of a process-based model with correlative models from three algorithms to understand the distribution of <i>P. californicum</i> at five spatial resolutions (1, 5, 10, 20, 50 km).

One of us (A.L.-N.) sampled occurrences of host trees infected by <i>P. californicum</i> across the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03')">Fig. 1</a>). We used roads as sampling transects as an efficient means of surveying the species' range limits, allowing us to gather information regarding the broader set of climatic situations where the species occurs. We used a GPS unit to record geographic coordinates for each infected host tree located within 100 m of the road. In total, we sampled 16,000 km (4153 km within the modeling extent) of roads, and collected 17,371 unique geographic coordinates of infected trees (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03')">Fig. 1</a>), 12,578 of which fell within the modeling extent (see below).</p> <p class="last">Sampling along roads may potentially bias the data, since roads are usually areas of higher water accumulation, thus impacting quality of the hosts (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Norton1')">Norton and Smith 1999</a>). However, given that we are generalizing prevalence of the species from host trees at several spatial resolutions (cells of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 km by side), we assume that the effect of roads is constant and will not influence our general understanding of mistletoe distributions. Identification of host and mistletoe species was achieved via collection of herbarium specimens at sites every ∼50 km across the study area or every time changes in host species composition were suspected. We used a second GPS unit to record landmarks by which to annotate general descriptions of species composition and vegetation physiognomy and landscape characteristics along the road; this information was used in processing aerial photographs (see below). All voucher specimens are deposited at the Ronald L. McGregor Herbarium, University of Kansas; copies of the collection were deposited at different herbaria in Mexico and the United States (see <i>Acknowledgments</i>). The two GPS units were Garmin 60CSx, with antennas to improve precision of coordinate estimates.</p> </div> <div id="s2b" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2"> <span class="title2" id="d2656322e633">Host tree mapping</span>  <p>To derive proportions of infected trees for the process-based model, we extracted geographic coordinates of tree canopies along roads sampled. This step was achieved using National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial photographs, ideal for tree mapping because of their high spatial and spectral resolution (1 m and four bands—red, green, blue, and near infrared). We carried out object-oriented classification of these photographs with the software eCognition 3.0 (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Baatz1')">Baatz et al. 2003</a>). We first identified all 3.75′ × 3.75′ aerial photographs that intersected the roads sampled. We further reduced the set of aerial photographs to those including the land use cover types in which mistletoe infections were found via comparisons with the 2001 National Land Cover Database (30 m resolution; <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Homer1')">Homer et al. 2004</a>); land cover types considered were barren land, cultivated land, deciduous forest, development low density, development medium intensity, development open space, emergent herbaceous wetlands, hay/pasture, herbaceous, open water, shrub/scrub, and woody wetlands. We selected at random 10% (67) of the aerial photographs for the states of Arizona (25; from 2007), New Mexico (6; 2009), California (13; 2009), and Nevada (23; 2006). Because of significant computational demands in the classification process, each 3.75′ × 3.75′ image was split into four equal portions for processing, generating a total of 268 images to classify.</p> <p class="last">In eCognition, we first segmented each image into two levels, with the following parameters: level 1 (scale = 10, color = 0.8, shape = 0.2, smoothness and compactness = 0.5) and level 2 (scale = 3, color = 0.8, shape = 0.2, smoothness and compactness = 0.5). Then, to classify trees, we selected polygons manually from the level 2 objects to be used as canopy samples, and classified each image using the standard nearest neighbor with the mean of each of the four bands (R, G, B, and NIR), the mean difference from neighbors, and the mean difference between the level 2 objects nested within the level 1 super-object. These procedures have been used in previous studies that have analyzed mesquite distributions in similar landscapes and regions (e.g., <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Laliberte1')">Laliberte et al. 2004</a>). Using ArcGIS 9.3, we dissolved the raw polygon output from eCognition to obtain single-tree polygons. This step was necessary because the output sometimes contained multiple polygons subdividing single tree crowns. Although this procedure sometimes reduced numbers of trees estimated, it was not a common problem overall, and estimates of trees were close to true numbers of trees in each image (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.617, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). This step allowed us to extract 5,786,586 polygons corresponding to tree crowns, and count actual numbers of trees within the 200 m strip along roads, to estimate proportions of trees infected (via the GPS coordinates of mistletoes described above).</p> </div> <div id="s2c" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2"> <span class="title2" id="d2656322e662">Climate, host, and disperser summaries</span>  <p>These datasets were each derived at five spatial resolutions, as follows.

Specifically, we asked for a total of 10,000 trees developed under the random forest protocol, from which we estimated the logarithm of the number of host trees with the following statistical model: log 10 of host trees ∼ GRS 2000 + NVG 2000 + annual mean temperature + annual precipitation + maximum temperature of the warmest month + precipitation of the wettest month + slope + elevation + aspect + latitude + longitude. The grass/scrub/woodland (GRS 2000) and barren/very sparsely vegetated land (NVG 2000) are raster data layers obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database v 1.1 (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Fischer1')">Fischer et al. 2008</a>).

This procedure allowed us to evaluate performance of each model as compared to random expectations, as well as to compare performance across scales and modeling methods. Partial AUC approaches limit analysis to portions of the ROC curve that are relevant to the question at hand (i.e., within omission error tolerances); so one calculates the ratio between the area under the curve for observed values against the area under the line of random discrimination, AUC ratios are expected to depart upwards from one as model performance is better than random. The main advantage of this procedure is that the comparison covers only the range of values over which each algorithm predicts, thus avoiding problem caused by using equal scales of values when such is not the case in all comparisons (e.g., Maxent and GARP; <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Peterson2')">Peterson et al. 2008</a>).</p> <p>To do this testing, we first multiplied grids by 1000, and converted each floating-point grid to an integer grid in ArcGIS 10.

However, interpretation of the roles of different variables, not being linked to mechanisms, was not straightforward, and potentially would lead to interpretations very different from what we observed using the process-based model (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Cabral1')">Cabral and Schurr 2010</a>). <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Araujo1')">Araújo and Luoto (2007</a>) used GAMs to test whether biotic interactions played a role at macroscales for the butterfly <i>Parnassius mnemosyne</i>: they found that the type of interaction (contingent on species) and methods considered played significant roles in explaining distributions of species at coarse scales. Other studies using correlative approaches have shown improvement in predictions of species' distributions when resource-related variables are incorporated (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Heikkinen1')">Heikkinen et al. 2007</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Real1')">Real et al. 2009</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Wisz1')">Wisz et al. 2012</a>). In our exercise, when we used correlative models, we also found that biotic-related predictors play a role at coarse scales, but were most relevant at scales finer than the macroscale of <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Araujo1')">Araújo and Luoto (2007</a>). These authors worked only at a scale similar to the coarsest of our analysis (50 km); they might have detected additional patterns if their analysis had extended to finer resolutions. Their results match ours at the coarsest resolution if we consider both disperser and host layers as part of the mistletoe's biotic interactions: in our case, the disperser layer showed some explanatory power, although not very significant, whereas, in Araújo and Luoto's example, the host plant distribution of the butterfly did not improve results drastically, but rather echoed climate signals (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f05" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f05')">Figs. 3</a> and <a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f06" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f06')">4</a>). Although these results from correlative models suggest that non-scenopoetic variables are important at coarse scales, the process-based model helped us to understand interactions among predictors, and revealed contrasting importance of factors at different resolutions.</p> <p>Our analysis suggests that different combinations of environmental predictors, whether biotic or abiotic, may affect interpretation of model predictions drastically, offering a step towards understanding model overfitting. Addition of the disperser layer resulted in concentration of the mistletoe's predicted distribution in the area of highest density of the disperser. Although model overfitting is known to complicate estimates of species' ecological niches (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Peterson1')">Peterson et al. 2007</a>), in this case, it also shows how combinations of abiotic and dispersal-related predictors restrict the area predicted as suitable. An improvement on this exploration would be to test for significance of explanatory power of other (less important) dispersers and perhaps different suites of hosts in the model.</p> <p>It is interesting to notice that the different modeling approaches produced predictions with only fair to good agreement. One possible explanation for such lack of coincidence is that the climate-only predictions agree closely with the distribution of the disperser, which is the element of the process-based model that covers the entire extent moving the parasite across cells in search for suitable conditions for its establishment (<b>M</b>; <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Barve1')">Barve et al. 2011</a>). However, in the metapopulation framework of the process-based model, the disperser is just one part of the formula, and how the mistletoe reaches its distributional limits depends on the balance between colonization and extinction. Assuming that the disperser actually carries mistletoe seeds all across the study extent and that hosts are present, our study suggests that the mistletoe is able to reach and potentially establish in areas more distant than the known geographic range edges; however, its populations are restricted to an area smaller than its “accessible area,” suggesting that other factors (including climate) constrain its survival. In a more realistic process-based modeling approach, actual seed processing times and dispersal distances could be incorporated (e.g., <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton2')">Overton 1996</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton3')">1997</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Liu1')">Liu et al. 2011</a>).</p> <p>The fact that the species is not present in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the disperser's range suggests that the species is responding to some combination of biotic and abiotic factors that reduces suitability in those regions (<a class="ref fig" id="i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03" href="javascript:popRefFull('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-f03')">Fig. 1</a>; see also <a class="ref" href="#appB">Appendix B: Fig. B1</a>). The two areas are consistently predicted as climatically suitable, but densities of disperser and hosts are much lower towards these two areas, very different from the central part of the study area, where we observed highest mistletoe abundances; areas similar to these areas may be worth exploring in detail for sink population dynamics. From observations during field work, the transition between absence and presence, moving from east to west, could also be explained by a combination of biogeographic barriers for the species and dramatic environmental gradients, which represent limits to dispersal (although other generalist and specialist species are present in these other regions) and successful establishment. Our observations do not suggest interference by other species (i.e., other biotic factors, such as competition) in this part of the range; rather, it is more likely that the species has not been able to adapt to abiotic conditions there, preventing it from being more widespread. This may explain why the species is restricted to the Sonoran Desert and parts of the Mojave Desert, and does not occur in other, adjacent desert areas in North America, such as California's Central Valley, the Chihuahuan Desert, or the Valle de Tehuacán in Mexico, that present different combinations of either hotter and wetter or colder and dryer climates, in comparison to areas where the species is present (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Dimmit1')">Dimmit 2000</a>).</p> <p>Although our exercise is realistic according to what we know about the species' distribution and how biotic and abiotic factors operate across scales, it carries some significant assumptions and limitations. First, the environmental predictors we used and the way they were developed is far from ideal. We chose predictors that are likely important to the species, but generating them and matching their resolutions was not always possible. In particular, this concern applies to the disperser layer: it was originally created at a spatial resolution of 461 km<sup>2</sup> (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Sauer1')">Sauer et al. 2011</a>), but data availability considerations prevented us from scaling it directly to other resolutions. Scaling it to high resolutions requires a larger density of survey routes than is actually available; as a consequence, we used this single resolution for the first four resolutions, and generalized it still more for the coarsest.</p> <p>Other bioclimatic variables could have been chosen, such as those associated with extremes of temperature and precipitation; however, in tests using other sets of climate variables and the entire set of 19 bioclimatic variables of <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Hijmans1')">Hijmans et al. (2005</a>), neither the process-based model nor the correlative approach appeared to benefit from such additional information (data not shown). To check this point more thoroughly, we tested the performance and geographic predictions of correlative models with two other environmental layers that were calculated using daily weather stations information for a period of 20 years: number of continuous days of freezing temperatures and number of continuous rainless days. However, these models did not produce results markedly better than annual mean temperature and annual precipitation visually, nor did models increase in performance, which suggests that different trends would not result in either the model prediction or in model performance.</p> <p>For the process-based model, it would be possible to create and explore other colonization and extinction functions. In particular, the extinction function used was a simple exponential of the difference between the estimated optimal niche and the environments of a given cell: clearly, more complex may prove more appropriate (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-MartinezMeyer1')">Martínez-Meyer et al. 2013</a>). However, based on extensive initial exploration and simulations (not shown), in which our basic results were supported, it is not likely that major differences and conclusions from our current findings would emerge.</p> <p class="last">Other types of information could be incorporated in new models, as well as in experiments that could analyze details of mistletoe population dynamics in different parts of the range. For example, numbers of viable seeds dispersed by <i>Phainopepla nitens</i> and other bird species may indicate regions with unfavorable niche conditions and sink population dynamics, or perhaps even other physiological mechanisms of host-parasite recognition. Other studies of such dynamics in <i>P. californicum</i> have been carried out at much finer resolutions than ours, and are very illuminating when compared with our macro-geographic approximations (e.g., <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton1')">Overton 1994</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Overton2')">1996</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Aukema3')">Aukema and Martínez del Rio 2002</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Liu1')">Liu et al. 2011</a>). From an ecological point of view, for example, these analyses would allow exploring whether abundance, genetic variation, population differentiation, or gene flow vary as functions of centrality within the geographic range (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Thuiller1')">Thuiller et al. 2010</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-Torres1')">Torres et al. 2012</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-MartinezMeyer1')">Martínez-Meyer et al. 2013</a>) or the ecological niche of the species, thus presenting different opportunities for local optima and associated adaptation (<a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-VanDerWal1')">VanDerWal et al. 2009</a>, <a class="ref NLM_xref-bibr" href="javascript:popRef2('i2150-8925-4-8-art99-MartinezMeyer1')">Martínez-Meyer et al. 2013</a>).</p> </div><div class="ack"> <a name="_i14"><!-- title --></a><table class="sectionHeading" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" width="95%">Acknowledgments</th></tr></table> <p class="last">We are thankful to Luis A.
