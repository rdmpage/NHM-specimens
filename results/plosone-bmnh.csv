The skull of this individual is incompletely known, however. The middle length of the jaws, occipital aspect and much of the mandible have broken away, leading most authors to conclude that the NHMUK R3877 skull is primarily represented by two, non-articulating pieces (e.g. , , -). The posterior component reveals a relatively tall orbital region, preserving most of a reclined, partially closed and slender orbit; the posterior region of a large nasoantorbital fenestra that, unusually, extends beyond the jaw joint and a fragment of the articulated posterior mandible. The anterior piece, which also includes the complete mandibular symphysis, contains the anterior end of the nasoantorbital fenestra, the entire dental series and a particularly low, crestless rostrum. The two pieces are separated by sizeable lengths of maxillae and premaxillae in the upper jaw and similar lengths of mandibular rami, but the exact lengths of these missing portions are unknown. No other I. latidens fossils have provided a complete jaw for comparison, although another set of jaws is known: UMZC T706/R392 (accessioned in University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, and possibly representing the lost jaws of the I. latidens holotype ). This material is badly crushed and the posterior skull remains – including the jaw joint or other hallmarks of the braincase region – are missing (MPW, pers. obs. 2007). Although more of the maxilla and mandible length are preserved in this specimen than BMNH R3877, the distortion of the skull renders it of questionable use in reconstructing the skull proportions of I. latidens and, at best, it only gives a minimum length of the jaws.",,,,,,,,,

Boulenger  (p. 43) placed this taxon in the genus Stenophis, provided a redescription and a head drawing and changed the locality to “unknown”. The reasons for rejecting this type locality remain speculative. Günther  noted that the specimen was “From M. Parzudaki's Collection”; Parzudaki collected in Central and South America –. Boulenger , however, placed the specimen in the genus Stenophis based mainly on dental morphology (maxillary teeth “13 or 14, equal”, p. 39–40 vs. “12 or 13, anterior longest”p. 44) and the presence of well-developed hypapophyses throughout the vertebral column. The latter character is used by Boulenger to characterize a very small number of snake genera, including Stenophis and Lycodryas. Because all other Stenophis spp. were from Madagascar, Boulenger most likely doubted the reported origin of the specimen. Notably, the two descriptions of the type specimen disagree in that according to Günther , the anal shield is “bifid”, whereas according to Boulenger  it is “entire”. Our examination supports the view of Günther.",,,,,,,,,

Sir Francis Day  described Ophiocephalus diplogramma in 1865 based on one juvenile specimen (42 mm in length) collected near the mouth of the Cochin River in the port city of Cochin (Southwestern India), and called it Malabar snakehead (Holotype at the Natural History Museum, London; BMNH 1865.7.17.24). The color pattern of this juvenile matched with that of juveniles of another species of snakehead, O. micropeltes originally described by Cuvier and Valenciennes  from Java, Indonesia. This possibly led Francis Day to synonymise C. diplogramma with C. micropeltes in 1878 . The close similarity, rarity of adult specimens in museum collections, and the fact that no taxonomist has studied this snakehead since its description, resulted in the acceptance of the synonymy by subsequent taxonomists , –.

For some of the meristic characters where one species did not show any variation, we performed one-sample t test with the character value of the species showing no variation as the hypothetical mean.

Most of the neural arch of the axis is broken (). The prezygapophyses are small and smooth surfaces placed at anterior and of the neural arch. The postzygapophyses are medially connected by a thin lamina that forms the roof of the posterior exit of the neural canal. The articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses are elongated and face ventrolaterally. The posterior end of the centrum is poorly preserved and it is not possible to determine whether the postzygapophyses extend beyond the posterior margin of the centrum (). The neural spine only preserves its posterior half, which is low, laminar, and thickens at its posterior end. Posteriorly, the neural spine is divided into two spinopostzygapophyseal laminae that project ventrolaterally and merge distally with the epipophyses.

The tip of the snout appears to be strongly consolidated due to the tight suture between the premaxilla and the median rostral (). Although the snout is heavily ossified, it may have been loosely attached to the lateral ethmoid, anterior nasal, and tectal (if present). This condition is also observed in Macropoma lewesiensis (BMNH 4207). The entire surface of the snout is ornamented with coarse rugosities, making it difficult to observe the suture between the bones precisely. The premaxilla is robust, bears no teeth, and is separated at the symphysis from its antimere by a large trapezoidal, median pore of the sensory line canal (m.p.s.c, ). Such a condition is also observed in Macropoma (.20B in ) and Latimeria ( p.s.m.e.m in ), but the median pore of the sensory line canal is much larger in Megalocoelacanthus. The ventral half of the premaxilla is very broad and the base of the bone extends medially as a thin flattened surface that closes ventrally the median pore of the sensory line canal (). The base of the premaxilla meets its antimere in a recess, posterior to the opening of the median pore of the sensory line canal. The anteroventral margin of the premaxilla is slightly folded ventrally, and crenate. Ventrally, the right premaxilla presents a raised area pierced by a pore that is directed posteroventrally.

Our phylogenetic analysis of Megalocoelacanthus supports the sister-group relationship with Libys, an Upper Jurassic genus from Bavaria, Germany. Although it is significantly smaller in size, Libys shares many features with Megalocoelacanthus. Notably, this genus also possesses a supraorbital sensory line canal that opens through a large, continuous groove stretched by pillars on either side of the parietonasal shield. When specimens of Libys are observed under binocular microscope (Dutel pers. obs. on BSPG XIV 501b, BSPG 1870 XIV 502, BMNH P3337), one can distinguish a suture between the base of adjacent pillars. It is thus probable that the same condition is present in Megalocoelacanthus, but because of the poor preservation, the suture between the supraorbitals cannot be seen. Despite the size difference, the lower jaw of Megalocoelacanthus and Libys are virtually identical, i.e. a slender and elongated mandible opened by large pores for the mandibular sensory line canal. These two genera also share the absence of a suture between the parasphenoid and the basisphenoid, which suggests fusion of the two bones, the presence of a narrow and unornamented parietonasal shield, and the palatoquadrate being very deep and short in length with a ventral swelling on the palate. Very few elements from the postcranial skeleton are present on the specimen AMNH FF 20267. However, the pectoral girdle which is preserved is virtually identical in shape and proportion in Megalocoelacanthus and Libys: the cleithrum is slender and elongated, and the clavicle is relatively very small compared to the whole pectoral girdle.",,,,,,,,,

The main distinguishing features of the species were the alleged absence of hooklets on the suckers, number and size of the rostellar hooks (single row) and the number of uterine diverticula. However, examination of the existing syntypes (though designated as vouchers) of G. sindensis (BMNH 1982.5.13.27) has shown that suckers are in fact covered with hooklets (see ) and that there are two rows of rostellar hooks (see  and ).

In contrast, the ilium of Mymoorapelta is flat in lateral view (). Ventrally, the acetabulum is formed between the moderately long pubic peduncle and squat, swollen ischial peduncle. It is located about midway between the medial and lateral margins of the ilium. The axis of the acetabulum is angled 50° posteriorly from an axis through the middle of the acetabulum perpendicular to the sacral vertebrae. This angle causes the femur to swing anterolaterally so that the knee clears the expanded gut; the femur does not move in a parasagittal plane. The preacetabular process has a crest ventrally that extends forwards from near the pubic peduncle. Anteriorly, this crest becomes the ventral margin of the preacetabular process. Near the pubic peduncle, this preacetabular crest separates a narrow shelf (the preacetabular shelf) from the main body of the preacetabular process. This shelf may have been for the origin for part of the M. iliotibialis. The preacetabular shelf and associated crest are present in Scelidosaurus, although are not as well developed. They are absent in Huayangosaurus and most stegosaurs, except Dacentrurus (BMNH 46013) and an unnamed Dacentrurus-like pelvis from China ( fig. 5f).",,,,,,,,,

The opposing articular surfaces of the dorsal and sacral centra are somewhat irregular and interlocking, thus resembling the typical irregular surface between sacral vertebrae of immature dinosaurs and implies the two vertebrae of Scelidosaurus were tightly interlocked. There is no caudal incorporated into the synsacrum. The sacrum of Scelidosaurus is composed of four vertebrae, which are unfused in BMNH R1111, owing to the immaturity of the specimen (the condition is unknown in the larger specimen represented by SGDS 131 due to matrix). The neural spines are distinct and not fused into a plate as seen in later ankylosaurs. Within the acetabulum, a ventral portion of sacrals 1 and 2 form a small part of the dorsomedial rim of the acetabulum, as it does in Gargoyleosaurus, as well as Gastonia, and Edmontonia (NMC 8531); the ribs are excluded from the acetabulum in primitive ornithischians (e.g., ) and stegosaurs, including Huayangosaurus.",,,,,,,,,

In the west it is currently known from north-west South Africa westward through Namibia, and just entering into south-west Angola (; []). These geographically isolated distributions coincide with two of the currently recognized subspecies of R. darlingi, R. darlingi darlingi and R. darlingi damarensis []. The holotype (BMNH 1895.8.27.1) of R. d. darlingi comes from Mazowe, Mashonaland, Zimbabwe, while that of R. d. damarensis (TM 9474) was from Oserikari, Damaraland, Okahandja District, in Namibia (). For this study, R. darlingi individuals were sampled together with several other rhinolophid species (Table S1 and Appendix S1 in ) at several sites in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe from 2008 to 2012 (). Species identifications were based on Monadjem et al. []. Wherever possible one male and one female were taken as vouchers from each site sampled. All other bats were released unharmed back into their roosts after data and tissue sample collection. We also obtained morphometric data and tissue samples from museum specimens of R. d. darlingi (See Table S2 and Appendix S1 in ). ",,,,,,,,,

Nine specimens each of the TMM-M U. woodmasoni and B. rhodogaster (completely disarticulated individuals not scored), and a previously CT-scanned specimen of Plectrurus aureus from the California Academy of Science (CAS 17177)  were additionally scored and included. The specimens of uropeltids from the Natural History Museum, London (BMNH), upon which the original character descriptions were based , also were examined and re-scored in person (JCO), except for the specimen of ‘Teretrurus rhodogaster’ (BMNH 1930.5.8.98), which was unavailable. Scores for the original outgroup taxa were checked using skeletal specimens from the University of California Museum of Paleontology (Cylindrophis rufus, UCMP 136995) and CT data (Anomochilus and Anilius) provided to us by the Squamate Tree of Life project (Deep Scaly).

That is not surprising, however, given that many more specimens were available for those two taxa. The variation in U. woodmasoni and B. rhodogaster does not appear to be bimodal (within the limited sample sizes), and therefore is unlikely to be related to sexual dimorphism, although that phenomenon has not been studied in uropeltids. Additionally, all TMM specimens of U. woodmasoni were collected from the same locality, reducing the possibility for geographic variation (). Most TMM specimens of B. rhodogaster also were collected from a single locality, although notably, no data were available for the potentially misidentified TMM M-10025, and TMM M-10026 and TMM M-10027 are listed only as from ‘S. India’ (). Note that our score for the absence of the interchoanal process in B. rhodogaster differs from that reported previously for a specimen of B. rhodogaster originally identified as ‘Teretrurus rhodogaster’ (BMNH 1930.5.8.59) . That and other scoring differences (Methods S2), as well as the results of our phylogenetic analysis, suggest that our B. rhodogaster and that specimen of ‘T. rhodogaster’ may not be conspecific. It is possible that either BMNH 1930.5.8.59 is Teretrurus sanguineus or that our specimens were misidentified, although nearly all TMM specimens of B. rhodogaster were collected from the type locality for B. rhodogaster",,,,,,,,,

On the afternoon of 26th July 2010 one of us (MW) observed the approximately last 30 seconds of an episode of active skin feeding, in which the normally quiescent hatchlings were moving rapidly over and around mainly the middle region of the body of their motionless mother, removing and ingesting pieces of her skin. Immediately following this the mother and young were observed for a further approximately 30 seconds during which the mother remained motionless and the young moved very slowly upon soil adjacent to the mother. This was our only direct observation of any post-hatching parental care. By 28th July the mass of the presumed mother had decreased from 3.7 to 3.09 g while the combined mass of the two hatchlings increased from 0.5 to 0.89 g. After a further six days the mass of the presumed mother had fallen further to 2.85 g and the combined mass of the two young had increased to 0.93 g. At this time the young measured 73 and 75 mm in total length and were able to burrow in loose soil.

The ethmosphenoid portion of the skull bears nine vacuities and the otoccipital portion five. Slender pillars (pi, , , , ) separate adjacent vacuities. Several pillars display a clear separation between their dorsal edge and the parietonasal shield. This could be attributed to the lateral compression, or it could suggest that most of the pillars may have been sutured to the parietonasal shield. We support the latter assumption based on the presence of clear suture between the anteriormost pillar and the lateral rostral on both side of the skull. Consequently, we identify the pillars as expansions of the supraorbital series. The condition observed in Megalocoelacanthus is thus very similar to that of the Jurassic genus Libys, where the pillars forming the large vacuity of the supraorbital sensory line canal are interpreted as elements of the supraorbital series (Dutel pers. obs. on BMNH P.3337). A twist in the orientation of the pillars is observable along the antero-posterior axis (, ). The first three pillars are oriented anterodorsally whereas the more posterior ones are oriented posterodorsally. The supratemporal bears one pillar, the posterior parietal four, the anterior parietal two, and the anteriormost ones are borne by the nasals. A vacuity occurs between the edges of adjacent bones of the parietonasal series (i.e. posterior parietal/anterior parietal; anterior parietal/nasal). The suture between the bones of the parietonasal series extends through the vacuity and is subsequently overlapped by the ventral edge of the cavity (). This suggests that the parietonasal series could have extended laterally on both sides of the skull, so that it was overlapped by the supraorbital series. The first three vacuities are more dorsal in position than the posterior one. Their shapes are also different along the antero-posterior axis (): the anteriormost vacuities are dorsoventrally flattened while the posteriormost are anteroposteriorly flattened. This suggests that on either side, the branches of the sensory line canal were oriented anteromedially along the ethmosphenoid portion of the skull, meeting dorsomedially behind the lateral rostral to form the antorbital sensory line canal commissure (ant.com.so.s.c, ). The position of the antorbital commissure is thus at the same level along the shield as in Latimeria",,,,,,,,,

The humerus (BMNH M 85318; ) is a complete left bone with minimal damage on the regions of the lateral supinator crest and the medial epicondyle. The bone is relatively short and robust (humeral width to length = 32%, Index 1 in ; cf. functional interpretation). The humeral head is large, laterally compressed and appears convex in lateral and medial views, the neck bowing moderately ventrally. The lesser tuberosity, where an important medial rotator muscle of the shoulder inserts (i.e., M. subscapularis), is tightly pressed against the dorsomedial surface of the humeral head. Dorsolaterally to and slightly above this head rises the greater tuberosity for the attachment of muscles involved in the lateral rotation of the shoulder and abduction initiation (i.e., M. teres minor, M. supraspinatus, and especially M. infraspinatus for which a prominent pit is present on the ventrolateral border of the tuberosity). In proximal view, the greater tuberosity has an oblique direction relative to the dorsoventral axis. It extends dorsally, delineating with the lesser tuberosity a wide and shallow bicipital groove for the tendon of M. biceps brachii, involved in the supination and flexion of the elbow. The deltopectoral crest, where important muscles for abduction, adduction, extension and medial rotation of the forelimb insert, rises above the humeral shaft. It extends dorsally and distally from the greater tuberosity to about three-fourths down of the bone, and tapers to merge with the diaphysis. The distal part of the humerus is divided into a curved trochlea for articulation with the ulna and a slightly convex capitulum for articulation with the radius. Moreover, the medial rim of the trochlea is more distal than the capitulum and the medial epicondyle. In ventral view, a supratrochlear foramen and a deep fossa are visible proximal to the trochlea. The distal humerus shows a strong medial epicondyle protruding ventrally, maybe related to the presence of an entepicondylar foramen . From this epicondyle originate the M. pronator teres as well as carpal and digital flexors. The broken proximal part of the medial epicondyle prevents to check the presence of an entepicondylar foramen. The lateral epicondyle is relatively short. In lateral view, it bears a prominent scar which is probably the insertion site for the common extensor tendon, origin of the digital and carpal extensors. A relatively developed lateral supinator crest extends proximoventrally to merge with the diaphysis about one-thirds the length of the bone.",,,,,,,,,

A. macrognathus (the best represented Apterodon species) and A. altidens are known from the late Eocene-early Oligocene beds of the Jebel Qatrani Formation –, . The oldest egyptian species, A. saghensis, is recovered from the late Eocene Qasr el-Sagha Formation . A. langebadreae nov. sp. exhibits smaller proportions compared to A. macrognathus (– and , ). The new Lybian species differs from it by the presence of a talonid basin on m2 and a M3 metaconule. Concerning the postcranial remains, the humerus of A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs from that of A. macrognathus (BMNH M 9257, cast of CGM 9445; figured by Andrews , pp. 229) in having a more developed lateral epicondyle and a stronger dorsoventral shortening of the distal part of the diaphysis relative to the proximal one. The flange of the anconeal process of the ulna is also less elongated proximomedially and the ventral ridge of the scar for the M. abductor pollicis longus is more dorsally placed than in the broken ulna of A. macrognathus (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described in Schlosser , pp. 80). The radial head is more curved in dorsal view with a higher capitular eminence by comparison to the complete radius SMNS 43467 attributed to A. macrognathus (described in Schlosser , pp. 80). Finally, no significant differences are observable relative to the fragmentary tibia of the Egyptian species (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described by Schlosser , pp. 80–81). A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs also from A. altidens by the presence of a m2 talonid basin and by an unreduced metacone and metastyle on M2, a wider M3 () on which is present a parastyle, a lower paracone, a wider protocone, and a more vestigial metacone. The third Fayum species, A. saghensis, is represented by a mandible only bearing p2–p4 and the basal crown of m1. This mandible shows smaller teeth compared to A. langebadreae nov. sp. () and the p4 is more than half higher than p3. The height difference between these premolars is much more important than in A. langebadreae nov. sp., although this character is likely to be variable within species . However, the attribution of the Qasr el-Sagha mandible to a separate species relative to the two other Fayum taxa is also questionable, premolars of Apterodon bearing very few characters to be diagnostic at the species level.",,,,,,,,,

The anteromedial pneumatic recess, also known as the pneumatic excavation , , is homologous to the posteromedial maxillary fenestra but differs from the latter by not leading to a maxillary antrum. An anteromedial pneumatic recess can be observed in many megalosauroids such as Piatnitzkysaurus (PVL 4073), Marshosaurus (UMNH 7825), Eustreptospondylus (OUMNH J.13558), Afrovenator (MNN UBA1), Megalosaurus (OUMNH J.13506) and Duriavenator (BMNH R.332).",,,,,,,,,

In ML 1100, the interdental plates extend almost as far ventral as the lateral wall, whereas the interdental plates of T. tanneri fall short and end well dorsal of the lateral wall of the maxillary body. This later feature is considered to be a synapomorphical character of the clade encompassing Torvosaurus and Megalosaurus by Benson  and Carrano et al. . It can also be observed in other theropods such as the tyrannosauroids Guanlong, Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the allosauroids Allosaurus and Neovenator (see ; pers. obs.). Britt  remarked that this character may be due to crushing but examination of ML 1186 seems to reveal that the interdental plates genuinely end well dorsal to the lateral wall of the maxilla. Nonetheless, it is difficult to know whether this feature can variate ontogenetically, intraspecifically or can genuinely distinguish two taxa. Based on very large and similar size of their maxillae, ML 1100 and BYU-VP 9122 clearly belong to animals of the same size and ontogenetic stage, and most likely fully adult individuals of more than nine meters (see below), so that ontogenetic variation cannot be taken into consideration. The maxillae of the different specimens of Dilophosaurus wetherilli (UCMP 37303, TMM 43646-1; Fig. S1), Ceratosaurus nasicornis (UMNH VP 5278; MWC 1), Majungasaurus crenatissimus (FMNH PR 2100, 2278), Marshosaurus bicentesimus (UMNH VP 7824, 7825; CMNH 21704), Megalosaurus bucklandii (BMNH R.8303; OUMNH J13506, 13559), Allosaurus fragilis (AMNH 600, 851; BYU-VP 2008; UMNH VP 5393, 9168, USNM 8335) and Tyrannosaurus rex (CMNH 9380; FMNH PR 2081; BHI 3033) all show similar ventral extension of the interdental plates. On the other hand, the two species of Carcharodontosaurus, C. saharicus (SGM Din–1) and C. iguidensis (MNN IGU2) can be differentiated on this aspect as the interdental plates of the former extend more ventral than the latter (pers. obs.). Based on this observation, the ventral extension of the interdental plate relative to the lateral wall may genuinely variate interspecifically and this feature is therefore considered to be a synapomorphical character differentiating the two species of Torvosaurus. To our knowledge, the presence of an interdental wall coincidental with the lateral wall of the maxillary body is an autapomorphical feature of T. gurneyi among Megalosauroidea.",,,,,,,,,

Davies). Lammidhan appears on Davies’ unpublished map and is located on a broad alluvial plain. However, it does not match a modern topographical landmark and its meaning is not known to local people. Eocene deposits occur to the north and south of the plain, with marine limestones and muds forming ledges usually towering over the unconsolidated muds that form the bottoms of valleys. These muds are the “Planorbis Freshwater beds,” and it is our contention that the specimen may have been found on these beds, but that it rolled down from overlying marine beds.

A non-type specimen from the Stephen’s collection (BMNH(E) 1239047) was used to validate the method prior to attempting the extraction from the lectotype specimen (BMNH(E) 1239048). All lab equipment and areas were cleaned with DNA Away surface decontaminant (Thermo Scientific), and new consumables and reagents were used to prevent cross contamination of DNA between extraction of the test specimen and subsequent extraction of the lectotype. In each case a single leg was removed and genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Micro kit as per manufacturer’s protocol “Isolation of genomic DNA from tissues”, modified by initially grinding the leg with a plastic micro-pestle in 20μl 1xTE buffer before the addition of lysis buffer (180 μl buffer ALT and 20μl proteinase K). The tissues were incubated at 56°C overnight (approx. 17 hours). In addition 1μg of carrier RNA was added to buffer AL at the appropriate stage. Cytochrome oxidase subunit (COI) sequences were amplified in eight separate reactions using the primer pairs designed by referring to COI sequences of the genus Chrysoperla deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (, .) in addition to C1-J-1718 and TL2-N-3014 []. Each reaction consisted of 1mM total dNTPs, 3mM MgCl2, 1.25u Bio-Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline), 0.1μM each primer and 1x reaction buffer (67mM Tris-HCl, 16mM (NH4)2SO4, 10mM KCl). Cycling conditions were: initial denaturation 94°C for 1 m followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final elongation of 10 m at 72°C. To increase the potential DNA yield from the lectotype the abdomen was extracted separately from the leg using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Micro kit as per manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications to minimise damage to external morphology: the abdomen was removed and soaked whole in buffer ATL with proteinase K at 56°C overnight, rather than ground or vortexed. 1μg of carrier RNA was added to buffer AL. Following extraction the abdomen was washed in 500μl of TE buffer, then in a series of TE/ethanol dilutions (50% ethanol for 5 hours at 4°c then 70% ethanol for 16 hours at 4°c) before being stored in 100% ethanol and imaged with a Zeiss Axio Zoom v.16 stereo microscope ().

The ascending ramus is broken dorsally, behind the m3 alveolar level, and distally before the condyles. The horizontal ramus shows three mental foramina in lateral view: beneath the p1–p2 contact, the p3–p4 contact, and a very small one under the p3 distal root. On DT25-1, the last mental foramina is absent or fused with the second one. In medial view, the mandibular symphysis extends ventrodistally to end at the level of the p3 distal root. The mental foramen opens approximately 3.5 cm behind the m3, slightly beneath the alveolar level. The jaw is rather shallow and particularly long, measuring approximately 16 cm from the beginning of the tooth row to the most distal part of the remaining ascending ramus.",,,,,,,,,

Except a small diastema visible between p2 and p3, the teeth are closely set together. The teeth morphology is more tubercular than sectorial as shown by the bulbous cusps. The incisors are so crowded that i1–i2 alveoli are located along a vertical axis. The canine is large and tends towards the labial side of the jaw. The p1 is single-rooted and more labially situated than the p2, as indicated by the alveolus. The other premolars of the jaw are two-rooted. The p2 and p3 are low-crowned and simply built: they bear a unique cusp, mesially placed with respect to the crown length, making the teeth asymmetrical in occlusal and lateral views. The p2 is more asymmetrical than the p3. Mesial and distal crests extend from the main cusps of these premolars to join the crown base. The p4 shows a tall main cusp, centrally positioned relative to the crown length, a tiny mesial shelf and a short and low talonid. The better preserved p4 on DT25-1 shows a talonid bearing an oblique cristid obliqua. Mesial and distal crests extend from the main cusp to join mesially the crown base and distally the cristid obliqua. The length and height of the premolars increase from p2 to p4. They are surrounded by a thick cingulid, more pronounced on the lingual side than on the labial one for BMNH M 85298 and at least well developed on the lingual side for the p4 of DT25-1 (worn labial side). The m1 is shorter than the p4, m2 and m3. It is broken and worn until the crown base, only the lingual side and the distolabial part of the talonid enamel being preserved. The trigonid outline is however visible. It seems to have retained a metaconid base and is slightly longer than the talonid. The poorly preserved m1 on DT25-1 shows also a shallow talonid basin. The m2 and m3 have a similar length. The trigonid is higher than the talonid. The paraconid, bending lingually, is the smallest cusp of the trigonid. The protoconid is the highest trigonid cusp. It is broader and distolabially situated relative to the paraconid. A faint enamel fold, which can be assumed as a vestigial metaconid, stands up on the distolingual side of the protoconid. This feature is visible on m3 but was certainly present on m2 also, the reduction of the metaconid being generally more important for the distal molars than for the mesial ones. The carnassial notch on the paracristid is short and feebly transversal, due to the weak lingual and labial extensions of the paraconid and the protoconid, respectively. A small precingulid rises just labial and basal to the paraconid. The paraconid position relative to the protoconid is more lingual in m3 than in m2. This makes the paracristid more transversally oriented in m3. Moreover, compared to the m2, the m3 paraconid and protoconid are higher and the precingulid is more developed. The talonid breadth is similar to the trigonid one in m2 but smaller in m3. Parallel to the labial border of these two molars, the talonid bears a short and weakly oblique cristid obliqua, extending distally from the base of the protoconid distal face to join a prominent and bulbous hypoconid. The hypoconid and the protoconid are aligned mesiodistally in m2. The hypoconid in m3 is slightly more lingual than the protoconid. In both molars, the labial cingulid stands up abruptely on the distal talonid, merging with the hypoconulid. The m2 hypoconulid is slightly lower than the hypoconid and separated from it by a narrow posthypocristid. These cusps are worn in m3. The m2 talonid also bears a shallow basin, absent in m3. Both molars have a crestiform entoconid surrounding lingually the talonid and merging mesially with the lingual cingulid.",,,,,,,,,

The most ventral part shows two scars which are probably the insertion sites of the M. rectus capitis posterior minor. The axial skeleton is represented by several vertebrae and a rib. Fragments of two cervicals are preserved. BMNH M 85335 shows a dorsally broken spinous process. Ventral to this process, zygapophysis processes are present laterally and medially. The spinal canal is wide and the underneath vertebral body (centrum) is ovoid in proximal view and triangular-shaped in distal one. The more ventral transverse processes are thin, oriented ventrolaterally and ventromedially, and show small transversarium foramina at their base. The specimen BMNH M 85335 seems to have a more distal position on the vertebral column compared to BMNH M 85313 as indicated by its wider spinal canal and its more mesially inclined spinous process. Both vertebrae can be c3–c6 as the c7 misses transversarium foramina and as the c1–c2 lacks a centrum and presents an odontoid process, respectively. The rib (BMNH M 85330) shows two articular surfaces with a vertebra: a dorsal tuberculum, which articulates with the transverse process, and a ventral capitulum, which meets on adjacent vertebral centra. As both structures are present and well-separated on this bone, it belongs probably to the proximal thoracic ribs.",,,,,,,,,

BMNH M 85315 is a subcomplete left bone, lacking its femoral head, and BMNH M 85317 and 85316 are proximal and distal epiphyses, respectively, of a right femur. The femur is longer than the humerus (). It is compressed dorsoventrally and its proximal part is twisted medially. On the specimen BMNH M 85317, the head, which articulates with the acetabulum, is nearly round and does not extend on the femoral neck. The neck is relatively long, so that the femoral head is bowed medially. In medial view, the fovea capitis, an ovoid depression where inserts the ligamentum teres, is located ventrally. Laterally to the femoral head lies a roughened greater trochanter for the attachment of the M. gluteus medius, M. gluteus profundus and M. piriformis, powerful hip extensors. It stands below the level of the femoral head. Distal to the proximal end of the femur are the lesser and third trochanters (on BMNH M 85315 and 85317). Below the femoral head, the prominent medial lesser trochanter, where the M. iliopsoas inserts, projects more medially than ventrally. Between the lesser and greater trochanters lies on BMNH M 85315 a deep trochanteric fossa, the attachment area of several lateral hip rotators. The trochanteric line, bordering laterally this fossa, is very thick. The lateral third trochanter, distal to the greater trochanter, is well-developed and slightly ventral. It is the insertion area of the M. gluteus superficialis. The distal femur bears a medial condyle more ventrally developed than the lateral one. In distal view, the patellar trochlea is weakly grooved and appears slightly more extended dorsoventrally than wide mediolaterally. The intercondylar fossa is as deep dorsoventrally as wide mediolaterally. The medial epicondyle bears a deep central depression, where may have been attached the medial collateral ligament, and a smaller pit, just proximal to it. This last area could be the attachment site of the medial head of the M. gastrocnemius, involved in plantar and knee flexions. The lateral epicondyle is rugose and bears distinct pits, certainly related to the insertion of tendons such as that of M. popliteus, which provides the flexion of the leg upon the thigh and unlocks the knee by rotating the tibia inward. They also might contain the insertion site of the lateral collateral ligament.",,,,,,,,,

The humerus (BMNH M 85318; ) is a complete left bone with minimal damage on the regions of the lateral supinator crest and the medial epicondyle. The bone is relatively short and robust (humeral width to length = 32%, Index 1 in ; cf. functional interpretation). The humeral head is large, laterally compressed and appears convex in lateral and medial views, the neck bowing moderately ventrally. The lesser tuberosity, where an important medial rotator muscle of the shoulder inserts (i.e., M. subscapularis), is tightly pressed against the dorsomedial surface of the humeral head. Dorsolaterally to and slightly above this head rises the greater tuberosity for the attachment of muscles involved in the lateral rotation of the shoulder and abduction initiation (i.e., M. teres minor, M. supraspinatus, and especially M. infraspinatus for which a prominent pit is present on the ventrolateral border of the tuberosity). In proximal view, the greater tuberosity has an oblique direction relative to the dorsoventral axis. It extends dorsally, delineating with the lesser tuberosity a wide and shallow bicipital groove for the tendon of M. biceps brachii, involved in the supination and flexion of the elbow. The deltopectoral crest, where important muscles for abduction, adduction, extension and medial rotation of the forelimb insert, rises above the humeral shaft. It extends dorsally and distally from the greater tuberosity to about three-fourths down of the bone, and tapers to merge with the diaphysis. The distal part of the humerus is divided into a curved trochlea for articulation with the ulna and a slightly convex capitulum for articulation with the radius. Moreover, the medial rim of the trochlea is more distal than the capitulum and the medial epicondyle. In ventral view, a supratrochlear foramen and a deep fossa are visible proximal to the trochlea. The distal humerus shows a strong medial epicondyle protruding ventrally, maybe related to the presence of an entepicondylar foramen . From this epicondyle originate the M. pronator teres as well as carpal and digital flexors. The broken proximal part of the medial epicondyle prevents to check the presence of an entepicondylar foramen. The lateral epicondyle is relatively short. In lateral view, it bears a prominent scar which is probably the insertion site for the common extensor tendon, origin of the digital and carpal extensors. A relatively developed lateral supinator crest extends proximoventrally to merge with the diaphysis about one-thirds the length of the bone.",,,,,,,,,

It is slightly shorter than the humerus (). The diaphysis is slightly compressed lateromedially and somewhat curved in lateral view. The proximal olecranon, where the major extensor of the forelimb (i.e., M. triceps) inserts, does not bend dorsally or ventrally with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bone, but is slightly medially inclined. It is long relative to the entire length of the ulna (approximately as long as the semilunar notch), as found generally in hyaenodontidans  (olecranon to ulnar length = 22%, Index 2 in ; cf. functional interpretation). Below the olecranon, the dorsal semilunar notch for the distal humerus is concave. Immediately distal to the lateral part of this notch is a relatively flat radial notch for the contact with the proximal radius. This notch is elongated dorsomedially to ventrolaterally but somewhat more dorsally directed. In dorsal view, the flange of the anconeal process, proximal to the semilunar notch, is concave and asymmetrical. Its medial rim is more proximal than the lateral one. A deep and longitudinal groove for the M. abductor pollicis longus (abductor of the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint and partial abductor of the wrist) is present along the lateral side of the ulna. Just lateral to the semilunar notch, this groove is delineated by a strong ventral ridge, where might be inserted the M. flexor digitorum profundus, a powerful digital flexor. A thinner ridge, more dorsally located and immediately distal to the semilunar notch, contributes to delineate the dorsal side of the groove. These ridges taper distally to disappear at the two-thirds of the bone, at the level of the interosseous tubercle which projects laterally. On the dorsodistal surface of the ulna, the region for the M. pronator quadratus, the main forearm pronator, is partly broken. The distal ulna presents a small radial facet for articulation with the ulnar facet of the radius, and a more distal and ventral massive styloid process for the articulation with the carpal.",,,,,,,,,

Two facets with the tarsal bones are visible on the lateral malleolus: the more lateral and distal one is in contact with the dorsal facet of the calcaneus, and the more medial and proximal one articulates with the lateral facet of the astragalus. The calcaneal facet of the fibula has a sinuous lateral edge and is dorsoventrally oblique. The astragalar facet is nearly oriented in the proximodistal axis of the bone. The separation between the two facets is roughly defined, except near the ventral crest which joins the lateral edge of both surfaces.

The ilium is broken proximally, just in front of the anterior inferior iliac spine. This spine, close to the acetabulum, has a very distal position. It is marked by a deep pit visible in dorsal view. The ilium neck is short and broader than the proximal branches of the pubis and the ischium. In lateral view, the acetabulum appears circular and is delineated proximally and dorsally by a high rim. Its lunate articular surface opens distoventrally. A broad rugosity, where inserts the M. rectus femoris, a powerful hip flexor and knee extensor, lies immediately proximal to the acetabulum. Ventrally to the acetabulum, a broad tuberosity for the M. iliopsoas, involved in flexion and lateral rotation at the hip joint, is present. The ramus of the ischium is relatively flat lateromedially. The acetabulum and the descending ramus of the ischium face more laterally than ventrally, as the descending ramus is not deflected outwards with respect to the ilium. Distal and dorsal to the acetabulum, the ischial spine, usually bearing the M. gemelli (lateral rotator and hip abductor), is poorly convex. Even if the pubis and the ischium are not entirely preserved, the obturator foramen, distal to the acetabulum, has been probably broad and elongated proximodistally.",,,,,,,,,

A. macrognathus (the best represented Apterodon species) and A. altidens are known from the late Eocene-early Oligocene beds of the Jebel Qatrani Formation –, . The oldest egyptian species, A. saghensis, is recovered from the late Eocene Qasr el-Sagha Formation . A. langebadreae nov. sp. exhibits smaller proportions compared to A. macrognathus (– and , ). The new Lybian species differs from it by the presence of a talonid basin on m2 and a M3 metaconule. Concerning the postcranial remains, the humerus of A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs from that of A. macrognathus (BMNH M 9257, cast of CGM 9445; figured by Andrews , pp. 229) in having a more developed lateral epicondyle and a stronger dorsoventral shortening of the distal part of the diaphysis relative to the proximal one. The flange of the anconeal process of the ulna is also less elongated proximomedially and the ventral ridge of the scar for the M. abductor pollicis longus is more dorsally placed than in the broken ulna of A. macrognathus (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described in Schlosser , pp. 80). The radial head is more curved in dorsal view with a higher capitular eminence by comparison to the complete radius SMNS 43467 attributed to A. macrognathus (described in Schlosser , pp. 80). Finally, no significant differences are observable relative to the fragmentary tibia of the Egyptian species (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described by Schlosser , pp. 80–81). A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs also from A. altidens by the presence of a m2 talonid basin and by an unreduced metacone and metastyle on M2, a wider M3 () on which is present a parastyle, a lower paracone, a wider protocone, and a more vestigial metacone. The third Fayum species, A. saghensis, is represented by a mandible only bearing p2–p4 and the basal crown of m1. This mandible shows smaller teeth compared to A. langebadreae nov. sp. () and the p4 is more than half higher than p3. The height difference between these premolars is much more important than in A. langebadreae nov. sp., although this character is likely to be variable within species . However, the attribution of the Qasr el-Sagha mandible to a separate species relative to the two other Fayum taxa is also questionable, premolars of Apterodon bearing very few characters to be diagnostic at the species level.",,,,,,,,,

Several pillars display a clear separation between their dorsal edge and the parietonasal shield. This could be attributed to the lateral compression, or it could suggest that most of the pillars may have been sutured to the parietonasal shield. We support the latter assumption based on the presence of clear suture between the anteriormost pillar and the lateral rostral on both side of the skull. Consequently, we identify the pillars as expansions of the supraorbital series. The condition observed in Megalocoelacanthus is thus very similar to that of the Jurassic genus Libys, where the pillars forming the large vacuity of the supraorbital sensory line canal are interpreted as elements of the supraorbital series (Dutel pers. obs. on BMNH P.3337). A twist in the orientation of the pillars is observable along the antero-posterior axis (, ). The first three pillars are oriented anterodorsally whereas the more posterior ones are oriented posterodorsally. The supratemporal bears one pillar, the posterior parietal four, the anterior parietal two, and the anteriormost ones are borne by the nasals. A vacuity occurs between the edges of adjacent bones of the parietonasal series (i.e. posterior parietal/anterior parietal; anterior parietal/nasal). The suture between the bones of the parietonasal series extends through the vacuity and is subsequently overlapped by the ventral edge of the cavity (). This suggests that the parietonasal series could have extended laterally on both sides of the skull, so that it was overlapped by the supraorbital series. The first three vacuities are more dorsal in position than the posterior one. Their shapes are also different along the antero-posterior axis (): the anteriormost vacuities are dorsoventrally flattened while the posteriormost are anteroposteriorly flattened. This suggests that on either side, the branches of the sensory line canal were oriented anteromedially along the ethmosphenoid portion of the skull, meeting dorsomedially behind the lateral rostral to form the antorbital sensory line canal commissure (ant.com.so.s.c, ). The position of the antorbital commissure is thus at the same level along the shield as in Latimeria",,,,,,,,,

In ML 1100, the interdental plates extend almost as far ventral as the lateral wall, whereas the interdental plates of T. tanneri fall short and end well dorsal of the lateral wall of the maxillary body. This later feature is considered to be a synapomorphical character of the clade encompassing Torvosaurus and Megalosaurus by Benson  and Carrano et al. . It can also be observed in other theropods such as the tyrannosauroids Guanlong, Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the allosauroids Allosaurus and Neovenator (see ; pers. obs.). Britt  remarked that this character may be due to crushing but examination of ML 1186 seems to reveal that the interdental plates genuinely end well dorsal to the lateral wall of the maxilla. Nonetheless, it is difficult to know whether this feature can variate ontogenetically, intraspecifically or can genuinely distinguish two taxa. Based on very large and similar size of their maxillae, ML 1100 and BYU-VP 9122 clearly belong to animals of the same size and ontogenetic stage, and most likely fully adult individuals of more than nine meters (see below), so that ontogenetic variation cannot be taken into consideration. The maxillae of the different specimens of Dilophosaurus wetherilli (UCMP 37303, TMM 43646-1; Fig. S1), Ceratosaurus nasicornis (UMNH VP 5278; MWC 1), Majungasaurus crenatissimus (FMNH PR 2100, 2278), Marshosaurus bicentesimus (UMNH VP 7824, 7825; CMNH 21704), Megalosaurus bucklandii (BMNH R.8303; OUMNH J13506, 13559), Allosaurus fragilis (AMNH 600, 851; BYU-VP 2008; UMNH VP 5393, 9168, USNM 8335) and Tyrannosaurus rex (CMNH 9380; FMNH PR 2081; BHI 3033) all show similar ventral extension of the interdental plates. On the other hand, the two species of Carcharodontosaurus, C. saharicus (SGM Din–1) and C. iguidensis (MNN IGU2) can be differentiated on this aspect as the interdental plates of the former extend more ventral than the latter (pers. obs.). Based on this observation, the ventral extension of the interdental plate relative to the lateral wall may genuinely variate interspecifically and this feature is therefore considered to be a synapomorphical character differentiating the two species of Torvosaurus. To our knowledge, the presence of an interdental wall coincidental with the lateral wall of the maxillary body is an autapomorphical feature of T. gurneyi among Megalosauroidea.",,,,,,,,,
